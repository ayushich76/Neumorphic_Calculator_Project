# Neumorphic_Calculator_Project
Developed a stylish, neumorphic design calculator using modern web technologies. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed and implemented a visually appealing user interface with a neumorphic design, ensuring an intuitive and engaging user experience. The project enhanced functionality and usability through responsive front-end development, facilitating seamless calculations. Additionally, I incorporated a dark theme and light theme toggle, allowing users to switch between themes for optimal visibility and comfort.
